# Twitter-sentiment-identification
In this project, I build a binary classification model using fully connected feed forward neural networks in Keras. 
The dataset has 100000 tweets in total. Each tweet has two columns: sentiment text and the corresponding sentiment 
label (0: negative, 1: positive). I use the first 80000 tweets to build the model and the rest 20000 as the validation
set to evaluate and report the performance (e.g., accuracy). The accuracy rate of test dataset is 81%
